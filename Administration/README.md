# Encryption Software

## How
For this task, I would **build a Password Manager** with the following features-
1. Keeping a **copy of the database on cloud**, so that data is not lost if hard drive gets corrupted.
2. Accessing the password database would require a single password (**hash**, which i will remember).
3. The database would not be readable by anyone else, as it would be **encrypted** with a hash.

## The Good
It is safe and secure.

## The Bad
It is difficult to implement and would take a lot of time.

## What i learnt from this task
I didn't anything about encryption. I learnt a little about how it works and some things about public and private keys. I still have no idea how i personally will implement such a software.
