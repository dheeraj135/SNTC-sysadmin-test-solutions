# Docker

I just **setup docker on my PC**, and **uilt an ubuntu docker image** on my system using this tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD436N0zw1Y> .  

Everything was fine, but the **proxy was needed to setup separately for docker**, which i realized very late. I setup proxy by following the tutorial here <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23111631/cannot-download-docker-images-behind-a-proxy>  

You can **access the repo here** <https://hub.docker.com/r/vsvipul555/vsvipul/>  

I **added the testfile.sh** but could not figure out how to configure the **docker run** command.
